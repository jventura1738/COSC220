# README for project 2: 7 Sort Analysis

This program has two executable files: test and main.  The test is what i used to run trials, the main is for the actual demo of the sorts.  The 5 required sorts have demos (bubble, selection, double-selection, insertion, exchange sort).  The two i did for fun were merge sort and heap sort.  The test executable was used for running trials and testing the sorting algorithm's speed using a stop-watch type class i made called Timer.  The main executable is just an interactive demo of the stats, run-time complexity, and the sorting steps.

## using the program

For the test executable: 'make test' is the command.  This executable is what i used for testing so you are better off using the regular 'make' command for the main executable.  Then run the main with './main' which will open the menu for checking out each sort's stats and demos.  You can test the timing for each sort with 1,000,000 elements (if you would like to test more or less, then the test executable would be of good use).
