# Project 3 README [Student Database Application]

This project is a .txt file based student database which allows the user to keep track of students in a class, department, or whatever scope necessary.  The students are managed using a doubly linked list (DLL), but are saved to a file for storage.  The program updates the file whenever the database and DLL are out of sync.  Meant to be a group project but I did it solo instead.

Instructions on how to run this application are located in the makefile.

## Funcionalities: 

- Add or Remove a Student.
- Display the Database in normal/reverse order.
- Search Student by ID or Name.
- Modify a Student.
- Sort Students by ID or Name (merge sort).
- Reset the database.
