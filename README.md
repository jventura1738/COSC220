# COSC220 : COMPUTER SCIENCE II

This is Justin Ventura's repository for COSC220 - Datastructures & Algorithms.


### Project 1: Shape Plot and Draw

This program can plot and draw the following shapes: circle, rectangle and square.  The plot is drawn on a 20x10 grid as that was all that was asked for.  The project itself was just to check if the shape fits the grid, the actual drawing in the terminal was created by me for fun.


### Project 2: Sorting Algorithm Analysis and Demo

This project involved an in-depth analysis including actual time trials on 5 different sorting algorithms: bubble, selection, insertion, double selection, exchange sort.  I also did the same for Merge and Heap sort for fun.


### Project 3: Doubly Linked List Student Database

This project was meant to be a group project but I decided to work alone.  This project consisted of a doubly linked list used to store data in a .txt file database.  The functionality includes: adding & removing a student, displaying the database, searching for a student by ID or name (autofills incomplete names), sort the list by ID or name (merge sort), and reset the database.  The interface is also very user-friendly and hard to break.
